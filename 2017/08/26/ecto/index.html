  <p>When I start to learn and work on Elixir, I really impressive about Ecto.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ecto is a database wrapper and language integrated query for Elixir.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>My personal feeling is Ecto is not magically like ActiveRecord. For example, Ecto doesn't support Lazy-Load, you need to allow data
  to be preloaded into structs. Lazy loading is often a source of confusion and performance issues and Ecto pushes developers to do the proper thing. Sound good, huh?</p>
  
  <p>Ecto also supports a mechanism to help you organize the schema across multiple contexts - break a large schema into smaller ones. Maybe one for reading data,
  another for writing. Or one for your database, another for your forms.</p>
  
  <p>And did you know the Plataformatec? They wrote a cool <a href="http://pages.plataformatec.com.br/ebook-whats-new-in-ecto-2-0">free Ecto ebook</a> and the book will be updated frequently when Ecto release new version.</p>
  
  <p>After few days reading the book below is my summary and of course, from the book, I also had few things don't completely understand. I will deep dive it again in this September.</p>
  
  <hr />
  
  <ul>
    <li>ORM - O is for Objects. Objects couple state and behavior together. For example, in the <code>product</code> object, we have state named <code>price</code> and behavior named <code>purchased?</code>.
  And with Ruby programming language, the code will be: <code>product.price</code> and <code>product.purchased?</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>But Elixir fails the "coupling of state and behavior". Behavior in Elixir is always added to modules via functions. Elixir provides structs to help us work with
  structured data.</p>
  
  <pre><code>    defmodule Product do
      defstruct [:price, :title]
  
      def purchased?(product) do
        # Do Sth
      end
    end
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>The call will be</p>
  
  <pre><code>    product = Product.new(title: "iPhone 8", price: 1000)
    product.price
  
    Product.purchased?(product)
  </code></pre>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>ORM - RM is Relational Mapper. Ecto provides schemas that map any data source into an Elixir struct. <em>When applied to your database, Ecto schemas are relational mapper</em></p>
  
      <pre><code>  defmodule Sample.Type do
    use Sample.Web, :model
  
    schema "types" do
      field :name, :string
      field :desc, :string
      field :slug, :string
      has_many :quotes, Sample.Quote
  
      timestamps()
    end
  end
  </code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>As you see, the schema <code>types</code> is the place you provide information for fields and set relationship to another model.</p>
  
  <p>And a schema may be end-up with hundreds of fields, relationships - this is a very bad schema. Therefore, it's better to break schema across multiple contexts, this would lead to simpler and clearer solutions.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Most queries in Ecto are written using schemas. And Ecto 2.0 adds many improvements to schemaless queries - allowing all database operations to be expressed without a schema. They tend to simple queries.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ecto supports test factories and we don't need to use a 3-party library for creating factories.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ecto has dynamic queries, allow us to build dynamic expressions that are later interpolated into the query. This feature is quite cool, and I noted here. Will come back to deep dive.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ecto introduces the ability to run queries in different prefixes. Data in different prefixes are isolated. This is really fit when you build multi-tenant application. <strong>One more note to deep dive.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ecto also includes <code>many_to_many</code> relationships - <strong>I'm sure will take a look about this in my current side project.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The last two things about transaction with Ecto.Multi and Concurrent test with SQL Sandbox - <strong>I will deep dive when I face these problems</strong></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
