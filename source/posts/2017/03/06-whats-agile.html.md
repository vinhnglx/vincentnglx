What's Agile? Recent years, many people say about Agile, Agile certificates, SCRUM master, Kanban. And almost people
thinks Agile is something big - they open Agile days/conference and they say we will use Agile to manage software projects.

Huh, honestly, I really hate those who say about that - Scrum, Kanban or certificates are ways to develop software better.
In my opinion, Agile are:

- Individuals and interactions overs processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

That's all. I only need to keep remember 4 manifesto.
